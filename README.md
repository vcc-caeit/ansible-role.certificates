--------------

This role only supports one variable, `certificates`. By default this is an empty list. You can specify `src`, `dest`, `data`, `owner`, `group`, `mode`.

    certificates:
      - src: which file to copy to the server
        data: content to copy to the server
        dest: file on the server to populate
        owner: file owner, defaults to 'root'
        group: file group, defaults to 'root'
        mode: file access, defaults to 0640 if 'private' is in `dest` and 0644 otherwise.
